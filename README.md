# Hello World! 👋

I'm Kanishk, an applied data scientist and engineer, keen to contribute in the application of Machine Learning. I am presently working at [GenInvo](https://www.geninvo.com/) where I develop NLP solutions across various products. I studied at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) from where I have research experience in working on 2 ML projects: designing a hybrid Optimization and Machine Learning model, and doing Stress Field Analysis using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

## Tech Stack

Project Management: JIRA (Atlassian), GitHub, GitLab

Programming Languages: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, Java

Deep Learning: Time-Series Analysis (RNN, LSTM, PyTorch), Natural Language Processing (LSTM, SpaCy, Gensim, Transformers), Computer Vision (OpenCV, Keras), GANs (U-Net, Transfer Learning, PyTorch)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Pandas, FourSquare

Cloud: AWS (SageMaker, S3, EC2, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, VPC), Terraform, GCP

Web Frameworks and APIs: Flask, Plotly, Dash, Hug
